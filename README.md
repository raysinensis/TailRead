# TailRead
analyzing large number of short sequencing reads for nontemplated nucleotide additions

TUTases add non-templated nucleotides to RNAs during RNA maturation and degradation. cRACE and RNA seq offer large amounts of data for RNAs of interest. A python program is in the works to read a folder of data, and output a summary of the percentage of transcripts with added tails, and the composition of those tails.

Work in progress...
